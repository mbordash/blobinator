Blobinator is a free cognitive content analyzer plugin for Wordpress providing deep text analysis of your articles, product descriptions, and page content.

== Description ==

Our free Blobinator cognitive content analyzer plugin for WordPress provides deep text analysis of your articles. With our cognitive approach to content analysis, you can get an objective review of your tone, discover hidden keywords and concepts buried within your content, and explore the emotions your articles are projecting.   Use these discoveries to adjust your writing style to your target audience and optimize search engine indexing through cognitive tagging and linking related keyword tags to your content. Works with both article content and product descriptions, like WooCommerce.

Features of our free WordPress plugin include:

*   Tone & Sentiment analysis (positive, mixed, neutral, negative)
*   Emotion detection and breakdown
*   Keyword and related keyword extraction
*   Concept extraction and discovery
*   Cognitive tagging for your content
